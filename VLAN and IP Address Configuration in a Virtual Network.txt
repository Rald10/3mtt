VLAN and IP Address Configuration in a Virtual Network 
Objective: The objective of this project is to configure IP addresses and VLANs in a virtual network environment to enhance network organization, security, and performance. By implementing VLAN segmentation and inter-VLAN routing, the network will ensure proper traffic management and improved efficiency.

Step 1: Network Design and Planning
Before configuring the network, I will design a topology with the following components:
•	1 Layer 3 Switch (for inter-VLAN routing)
•	6 End Devices (3 devices per VLAN)
•	2 VLANs 
o	VLAN 10 → Admin_Traffic
o	VLAN 20 → Guest_Traffic

Step 2: Network Setup in Cisco Packet Tracer
1.	Launch Cisco Packet Tracer
2.	Add Network Devices 
o	Drag and drop the following devices into the workspace: 
	1 Layer 3 Switch
	6 PCs
	Appropriate cables (Copper Straight-through for switch-to-PC, Copper Cross-over if needed for switch-to-switch connections)
3.	Connect Devices 
o	Connect 3 PCs to switch ports assigned to VLAN 10
o	Connect 3 PCs to switch ports assigned to VLAN 20
________________________________________
Step 3: Configure VLANs on the Layer 3 Switch
1.	Access the Switch CLI
o	Click on the switch and go to the CLI tab.
o	Enter privileged mode: 
enable
o	Enter global configuration mode: 
configure terminal
2.	Create VLANs and Assign Names
vlan 10
name Admin_Traffic

vlan 20
name Guest_Traffic
3.	Assign Switch Ports to VLANs
o	Assign ports FastEthernet 0/1, 0/2, and 0/3 to VLAN 10:
interface FastEthernet0/1
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10

interface FastEthernet0/2
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10

interface FastEthernet0/3
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10
o	Assign ports FastEthernet 0/4, 0/5, and 0/6 to VLAN 20:
interface FastEthernet0/4
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 20

interface FastEthernet0/5
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 20

interface FastEthernet0/6
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 20

Step 4: Configure Inter-VLAN Routing
Since we are using a Layer 3 switch, we need to enable routing between VLANs.
1.	Enable Routing on the Switch 
interface vlan 10
ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown

interface vlan 20
ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown

ip routing

Step 5: Configure IP Addresses on End Devices
1.	On PC1, PC2, and PC3 (VLAN 10 - Admin Traffic)
o	IP Address: 192.168.10.2 / 192.168.10.3 / 192.168.10.4
o	Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
o	Gateway: 192.168.10.1
2.	On PC4, PC5, and PC6 (VLAN 20 - Guest Traffic)
o	IP Address: 192.168.20.2 / 192.168.20.3 / 192.168.20.4
o	Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
o	Gateway: 192.168.20.1
________________________________________
Step 6: Verify Configuration
1.	Ping Devices within the Same VLAN
o	From PC1, ping PC2 (ping 192.168.10.3) → should be successful.
o	From PC4, ping PC5 (ping 192.168.20.3) → should be successful.
2.	Ping Devices Across VLANs (Inter-VLAN Routing Test)
o	From PC1 (192.168.10.2), ping PC4 (192.168.20.2) → should be successful if inter-VLAN routing is working.
3.	Use Traceroute to Analyze Traffic Flow
o	Run tracert 192.168.20.2 from PC1 to confirm routing path.
Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the configuration of VLANs, IP addressing, and inter-VLAN routing, ensuring proper network segmentation and communication between VLANs.
