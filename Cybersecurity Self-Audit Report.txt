Cybersecurity Self-Audit Report
FE/24/6475710187


Objective: This report details an audit of my personal cybersecurity practices, identifying strengths, weaknesses, and an improvement plan to enhance my digital security posture.
Findings
1.	Passwords and Authentication
•	Some passwords are reused across multiple accounts and are not regularly updated.
•	Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for critical accounts, but a password manager is not in use.
•	Risk Level: High (Increased risk of credential compromise.)
2.	Device Security
•	Antivirus software and firewalls are active, but regular security checks are not consistently performed.
•	Updates for the operating system and software are installed, but sometimes delayed.
•	Risk Level: Medium (Potential exposure to malware and security vulnerabilities.)
3.	Social Media Privacy
•	Privacy settings are configured on some accounts, but not all are reviewed regularly.
•	Some personal information is publicly visible, creating potential risks.
•	Risk Level: Medium (Increased exposure to social engineering and identity theft.)
4.	Email Practices
•	Awareness of phishing threats exists, but sophisticated attacks still pose a challenge.
•	Suspicious emails and links are generally avoided, but verification practices need improvement.
•	Risk Level: Low to Medium (Possible vulnerability to phishing and email scams.)
5.	Data Backup and Encryption
•	Backups are performed manually but could be automated.
•	Data is not encrypted, creating a security risk if devices are compromised.
•	Risk Level: High (Potential data loss or exposure in case of a breach.)
Improvement Plan
1.	Password Security
•	Implement a password manager to generate and store unique passwords.
•	Enforce regular password updates across all critical accounts.
2.	Device Protection
•	Automate security scans and updates to ensure system protection.
•	Regularly check and optimize firewall settings.
3.	Privacy Enhancements
•	Conduct a thorough review of social media privacy settings and update them monthly.
•	Reduce the amount of publicly shared personal information.
4.	Email Security Awareness
•	Take additional training on phishing detection and email verification methods.
•	Enable advanced spam filtering and security tools for email accounts.
5.	Data Protection
•	Encrypt sensitive data and files to prevent unauthorized access.
•	Automate data backups to a secure, encrypted cloud or external storage.
Monitoring and Review
•	Implement a cybersecurity self-audit every six months to assess progress.
•	Set up security alerts and periodic training to stay informed about emerging threats.
•	Track improvements using security tools and updated best practices.
Conclusion By implementing the outlined security improvements, I aim to enhance my digital safety and reduce potential vulnerabilities. Regular audits and proactive measures will ensure long-term cybersecurity resilience.
